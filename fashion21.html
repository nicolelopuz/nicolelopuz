            <h3 class="section-heading">Context</h3>

            <p>Fashion 21 was born from the idea of fresh look for the new woman of the 21st century. It was to offer Filipinas a new brand of imported, good quality and long-lasting makeup at an affordable price.</p>

            <p>Fashion 21 Cosmetics is a Filipino brand. </p>

            </a>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Problem</h3>

            <p>They recently rebranded their line and also want to modernize the style of their website. The client also wants a catalog of products where users can interact. A brand that wants a fresh, minimal and 21st century feel.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Strategy</h3>
            <p>Fashion 21 offers a vibrant and fresh vibe that fits young filipinas personalities. The brand style guide helped in creating a website that has the same aesthetics in order to have consistent identity design. Red was used as accents giving emphasis on the specific information or title.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Solution</h3>
            <p>My involvement was in giving Fashion 21 a complete overhaul website from their previous one. The challenge was to transform an old dated website into a fresh, trendy and fashion forward.</p>
