            <h3 class="section-heading">Discovery and Exploration</h3>

            <p>Knots and Pans is a web based application made in wordpress. The user interface as well as the experience was chosen from a pre-made theme for ecommerce.</p>

            <p>The client came to me with a list of problems and what she wanted to accomplish. Based on the list, I decided to gather and study the analytics of their site. I also tried navigating and creating my own registry. The site also is not mobile responsive ready. So I iterated on many variations of user flow and wireframes from creating a registry down to adding a gift, this gives us clarification on which in the list of be done first.</p>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/img 12.jpg" alt="">
            </a>

            <p>I've given her a set of wireframes to give her the idea of how it would look like and what the users would go through.</p>

            <p>Based from the feedback we got from the wireframes, we decided to focus on adding gifts in the registry where a lot of users don't succeed. I created high-fidelity mockup variations in order to see which would be best for the users so we A/B test it for a week.</p>

            </a>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Results and Lessons</h3>
            <p>70% of guests who registered in the platform tried exploring and adding gifts to their cart. This is surely a success rate from the previous analytics that users are only pushed to add gifts to cart when they really need to checkout.</p>

            <p>Solving things needs time and patience, the users are always right so carefully learn from them and base all decisions from the gathered data.</p>
