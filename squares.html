              <h2>Squares</h2>
              <p class="subheading">The mobile platform that shapes information flow most especially to large and distributed workforce. It allows HR and Communications leaders to reach everyone in their enterprise whenever, wherever and however.</p>

            </a>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Context</h3>

            <p>Most of the time employees get updates through bulletin boards or emails that usually they don't give more attention to. Squares is a solution for making employee lives more convenient by having all the company updates and news be readily available in the pocket of their hand.</p>

            <p>Squares is exclusively available in both iOS and android platform for Storm's clients or customers.</p>

            </a>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Problem</h3>

            <p>This product is something new for our existing clients. There are a lot of products that works like Squares but one thing companies don't deal with what we currently have in the market is security and the need of integration from their own systems to our own.</p>

            <p>The idea of having an application where everyone in the company visits from time to time to see for themselves the new information and to be aware of what is currently happening. Most employees nowadays are highly active in social media, we want to iterate the same behavior with more important and relevant company news.</p> 

            <blockquote class="blockquote">We only want employees to be highly engaged in the company they are in.</blockquote>


            <h3 class="section-heading">Process</h3>

            <p>1. User Research</p>

            <p>2. Analyze Data Gathered</p>
            
            <p>3. Wireframes</p>

            <p>4. High-fidelity Mockups</p>

            <p>5. Prototype</p>

            <a href="">

            <span class="caption text-muted">A sample wireframes of Checkout Process in Marketplace.</span>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Insights</h3>
            <p>I solely work with this project as the only user experience designer, brainstorming isn't ideal for this situation. The thing I learned is having a team not necessarily with the same field as I, would really help think differently of what other features  and how we would design the architechture of the whole application as well as the experience. Seamless teamwork is indeed needed within product owners, developers as well as sales team from the ideation down to the very last step.</p>

            <p>From our surveys, employees really like the sense of being a part of the collective receiving news from CEO, executives and supervisors. They also want to add more interaction with other co-works through comments or liking a post. In terms of analytics, employees are likely to tap and see announcements when they get notified through push notifications.</p>
