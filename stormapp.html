            <h3 class="section-heading">Context</h3>

            <p>Storm App is a platform available in iOS, android and web. It is exclusive to BPOs and other companies to loop in employees on company updates as well as redeeming employee awards. One of the main feature of Storm App is employee performance </p>

            <p>After creating Squares in Storm Technologies, product owners, product designers, developers, sales and executives come up with a plan to grow and improve Storm's products which is to make a platform. It will serve employees down to customizing there benefits and incentives to knowing news as well as congratulating there co-workers for job well done.</p>

            </a>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Problem</h3>

            <p>The previous systems built was created individually with their own branding and features. The challenge was merging them into a platform that will serve the needs of an employee.</p>

            <p>We had up and running Flex as a product that enables employees to customize their benefits and reward them with options that we have in our marketplace as a way of thanking them for being part of the company. One other product is Kudos which enables manangers or supervisors to thank and reward the team or co-workers for a job well done. The award system and redeeming happens on both of the products but the award itself is the marketplace. It has tons of products that local merchants gives us prices below srp.</p> 

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Not only are we improving another version of the system but also making our employees / customers happy. We want to solve the flow of completing purchases in the previous system version to. </blockquote>


            <h3 class="section-heading">Process</h3>

            <p>First and foremost, to understand all the problems that went wrong on the previous system. Why employees can't proceed to the next steps in completing a purchase.</p>

            <p>A user flow of buying an item to completing purchases must be rundown in order to know if we have the necessary steps to go from point A to B.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">A sample wireframes of Checkout Process in Marketplace.</span>

            <p>Next step, would be creating wireframes on how it would look like. In this step, developers, product owners and other product designers are able to give feedback on the early on-set to get collaborative effort and seamless productivity cycle.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Side by side comparison of an iOS and android mockups.</span>

            <p>As much as we want to have a cohesive experience with both platform, we also want the user not to feel alienated whether they are using iOS or android. We want them to be comfortable with the platform they are on so we stick to the standard design guidelines.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Results and Lessons</h3>
            <p>This project needs more testing and user validation.</p>

            <p>It is always a better idea to stick on information that we get from our customers or employees. Funnel analysis are very valuable to get us to defining the goal of our users and know the conversion rates on specific behaviors. We still lack data on these but eventually as more users are registered then we get to analyze more and improve the system.</p>
