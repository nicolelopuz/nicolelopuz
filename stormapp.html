            <h3 class="section-heading">Context</h3>

            <p>Storm App is a platform available in iOS, android and web. It is exclusive to BPOs and other companies to loop in employees on any company updates as well as redeeming employee awards. One of the main feature of Storm App is employee performance </p>

            <p>After creating Squares in Storm Technologies, product owners, product designers, developers, sales and executives come up with a plan to grow and improve Storm's products which is to make a platform. It will serve employees down to customizing there benefits and incentives to knowing news as well as congratulating there co-workers for job well done.</p>

            </a>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Problem</h3>

            <p>The previous systems built was created individually with their own branding and features. The challenge was merging them into a platform that will serve the needs of an employee.</p>

            <p>We had up and running Flex as a product that enables employees to customize their benefits and reward them with options that we have in our marketplace as a way of thanking them for being part of the company. One other product is Kudos which enables manangers or supervisors to thank and reward there team and co-workers. The award system and redeeming happens on both of the products mentioned but the award itself is the marketplace which has tons of merchants and prices below srp.</p> 

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Not only are we improving another version of the system but also making our employees / customers happy. We want to solve the flow of completing purchases in the previous system version to. </blockquote>


            <h3 class="section-heading">Process</h3>

            <p>First and foremost, understanding all the problems that went wrong on the previous system. Why employees can't proceed to the next steps in completing a purchase.</p>

            <p>A user flow of buying an item to completing a purchase must be rundown in order to know if we have the necessary steps to go from point A to B.</p>

            </a>

            <span class="caption text-muted">A sample wireframes of Checkout Process in Marketplace.</span>

            <p>Next step, would be creating wireframes on how it would like. In this step, developers, product owners are able to give feedback as product designers would only show what's best for the users.</p>

            </a>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Side by side comparison of an iOS and android mockups.</span>

            <p>As much as we want to have seamless experience with both platform, we also want the user not to feel alienated whether they are using iOS or android. We want them to be comfortable with the platform they are in so we adapt some standard guidelines from both platform.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Results and Lessons</h3>
            <p>A product or a platform itself needs to have a lot more of heads in solving the current user problems as well as researching on the new features that needs validation.</p>

            <p>It is always a better idea to stick on information that we get from our customers or employees. There comments and how they navigate the platform gives us the idea on how to improve and solve things.</p>
